30 Spider Crawl,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The spider crawl is a bodyweight exercise that involves crawling on the floor with the knees outside of the elbows. It is different from a leopard crawl in that the hips are higher, and it's different from a bear crawl because the knees are wider. It can be done as a full-body warm-up, in short bursts for power or circuit training, or for longer durations as cardiovascular conditioning."
Spider crunch,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The spider crunch is a core exercise that begins in a straight-arm plank position and involves raising one knee toward your same-side elbow to target the obliques. It is similar to a mountain climber, but with the knees out wider. It can be performed for time or reps as bodyweight ab training or conditioning."
Toe-touch,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The toe-touch is a bodyweight movement that targets the muscles of the abs, the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles in particular. It can be performed for time or reps in the ab-focused portion of any workout."
30 Hanging Toes-To-Bar,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The hanging toes-to-bar is an advanced abdominal exercise in which the lifter touches their feet to a pull-up bar. There are many ways to perform this movement: strict or swinging, arms completely straight or slightly bent, legs straight or bent, each providing unique benefits and challenges. Initially, it may be a difficult move to do for a single rep, but once you build the requisite core, lat, and shoulder strength, it can be performed for higher reps."
30 V-Up,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The V-up is a bodyweight movement that targets the muscles of the abs, the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles in particular. It is similar to a suitcase crunch, but the lower back lifts off the ground at the top of each rep. It can be performed for time or reps in the ab-focused portion of any workout."
Cocoon crunch,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The cocoon crunch is a bodyweight exercise targeting the ab muscles, the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles in particular. It involves bringing your knees to your chest and your arms from overhead to center. It can be performed for time or reps as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout."
Bench oblique crunch,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The bench oblique crunch is an exercise that targets the obliques, the muscles running alongside the rectus abdominis. The range of motion is fairly small, but it still does a great job of working these hard-to-isolate muscles. Like most crunch variations, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more."
Full moon-,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The full moon is a bodyweight exercise targeting the muscles of the abs. It is similar to a V-up, but with the added challenge of “drawing” a circle shape in the air during each rep. It can be performed for time or reps in the core-focused portion of any workout."
Push-up to side plank,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The push-up to side plank is an upper-body and core-focused exercise combining two popular bodyweight movements. It targets the chest, triceps, and shoulders with the push-up, and the obliques and hip external rotator muscles with the side plank. It can be performed as part of a dynamic warm-up or any bodyweight strength-training workout."

Total Fitness Ab Tuck,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The hollow-body knee tuck is a bodyweight abdominal exercise performed on the floor. It is similar to both the hollow-body hold and the knee tuck or reverse crunch, combining elements of both. It primarily targets the muscles of the rectus abdominis, or “six-pack” muscles. It can be performed for reps or time, either as part of an ab-focused workout or as a component of a circuit workout."
Active hang from bar,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The active hang from bar is a static exercise that involves isometrically squeezing the shoulders into the sockets and activating the muscles of the upper back and core. It can be used to improve pull-up form or to do more pull-ups, but also has postural and shoulder health benefits."

It can be performed for time or reps as part of a dynamic warm-up or as a mobility or restorative exercise anytime. It can also work as part of a yoga or bodyweight sequence with other poses.
Crab walk,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The crab walk is a full-body exercise that has been popular in schools and gym classes for decades. It's a full-body coordination challenge that also burns serious calories, making it an excellent inclusion in a full-body warm-up or bodyweight circuit workout."
Lunge with overhead reach,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,The lunge with overhead reach is a full-body bodyweight movement targeting the quads and shoulders. It has both strength and mobility benefits and can be performed one leg at a time or alternating for time or for reps.
Hang from bar,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The hang from bar is a static exercise that involves hanging from a bar by two hands. It can either be an ""active hang,"" where you pack the shoulders and activate the muscles of the upper back, or a ""passive hang,"" where you let the shoulders unpack and let the muscles of the upper body stretch. A passive hang may not be appropriate for all people depending on their shoulder health, but many coaches believe hanging can be healthy for the shoulders when done properly."
Total Fitness Hollow Hold,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The hollow-body hold is an isometric exercise that increases strength and stability in the core muscles. It is common in gymnastics training, CrossFit training, and as a core tension and bracing drill for lifters and athletes of all types. It is performed for time and can be performed as an activation drill prior to lifting, as part of a circuit, or as equipment-free core training anytime."
Total Fitness Side Plank,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The side plank is a popular isometric abdominal exercise focusing on the oblique muscles, as well as the transversus abdominis or deep core muscles. It is sometimes paired with the curl up and bird dog as the “McGill big three” for core strength and stability. It is performed for time and can work in a warm-up or in the core-focused portion of any workout."

Total Fitness Spider Crawl (Unweighted),力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The spider crawl is a bodyweight exercise that involves crawling on the floor with the knees outside of the elbows. It is different from a leopard crawl in that the hips are higher, and it's different from a bear crawl because the knees are wider. It can be done as a full-body warm-up, in short bursts for power or circuit training, or for longer durations as cardiovascular conditioning."
Total Fitness V-Up,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The V-up is a bodyweight movement that targets the muscles of the abs, the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles in particular.

Hand shift plank,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,The hand shift plank is a progression of the straight-arm plank exercise where you maintain a plank position as you shift your hands side to side. The additional movement forces the core muscles to work harder to stabilize.
Cross-body plank march,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The cross-body plank march is an exercise targeting the entire core but especially the obliques. It’s more difficult than a standard plank, with the extra stabilization challenge of bringing one knee at a time off the ground toward the opposing elbow. This will increase the challenge to the core and shoulder muscles, but also present a coordination and balance challenge."
Bent-knee Copenhagen hip adduction,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The bent-knee Copenhagen hip adduction is an advanced exercise that combines the isometric stabilization of the Copenhagen plank with dynamic adductions to challenge the core stabilizers and adductors. This exercise targets the same muscles as the side plank, including the obliques, shoulders, and lateral hips, but places extra emphasis on the adductors and is more difficult than side planks on the floor. Most lifters will need to progress to this version after mastering the basic side plank or Copenhagen plank first."
Copenhagen plank,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The Copenhagen plank is an advanced version of the side plank performed with one foot on a bench and the other foot hovering under it. This exercise targets the same muscles as the side plank, including the obliques, shoulders, and lateral hips, but places extra emphasis on the adductors and is more difficult than side planks on the floor. Most lifters will need to progress to this version after mastering the basic side plank or feet-elevated side plank first."
ACFT Hanging leg tuck,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The hanging leg tuck is an exercise targeting the entire body, including the arms, upper back, abs, and hip flexors. This specific exercise is part of the new Army Combat Fitness Test or ACFT. It is performe while hanging from a bar and combines elements of a pull-up with a leg raise. Experienced lifters make these look easy, but beginners may need time to build up to sets of 8-12 reps."
Alternating hanging knee raise,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The alternating hanging knee raise is an exercise targeting the abs, but which also works the lats and hip flexors. Rather than performing both legs at a time, you lift one knee at a time and alternate with each rep as if marching in place. Knee raises are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more, as part of ab-focused training."

Dumbbell suitcase crunch,力量训练,Abdominals,药球,Intermediate,"The dumbbell suitcase crunch is a weighted version of a popular abdominal training exercise.

Medicine ball rotational throw,力量训练,Abdominals,药球,Intermediate,"The medicine ball rotational throw is an explosive exercise targeting the abdominals, including the obliques, as well as the hips and upper back. It involves standing sideways to the wall and twisting the torso to hurl a medicine ball into the wall, then catching the ball on the ricochet. It can be performed for lower reps with a focus on power, or for higher reps with a focus on fat loss and conditioning."
Hollow-hold ball toss,力量训练,Abdominals,药球,Intermediate,"The hollow-hold ball toss is a more difficult version of the hollow-body hold exercise. It involves tossing a ball to a partner while maintaining an isometric hold in the hollow-body position. It can be done for reps or time in any ab-focused workout, or in an ""I go, you go"" format."
Partner front Russian twist and pass,力量训练,Abdominals,药球,Beginner,"The partner front Russian twist and pass is a weighted version of a popular abdominal training exercise that also utilizes a training partner to add another dynamic component. It targets the oblique muscles, as well as the deep muscles of the core and the rectus abdominis or ""six pack"" muscles. It can be done for reps or time in an ab-focused portion of any workout."
Sit-up with single-arm overhand throw,爆发力训练,Abdominals,药球,Intermediate,"The sit-up with single-arm overhand throw is an exercise targeting the core muscles, but the inclusion of the throw also brings in other upper-body muscles. When you come to the top of the sit-up position, you throw a medicine ball using one arm to a partner who then throws it right back to you to be caught with both hands. It can be performed for time or reps as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout."

Medicine ball half moon,力量训练,Abdominals,药球,Intermediate,"The medicine ball half moon is a dynamic core exercise performed around and over a medicine ball or other short, stationary object. It is similar in some ways to a V-up or reverse crunch, and targets both the obliques and the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles. It can be performed for reps or for time, usually in dedicated ab training or as part of a medicine ball and bodyweight circuit workout."
Exercise ball roll-out,力量训练,Abdominals,药球,Intermediate,"The exercise ball roll-out is an exercise that strengthens the core, shoulders and upper- back muscles. It starts in a plank-style position, with the arms resting on a ball. Then, roll the ball out in front of you as far as you can while maintaining a strong, neutral spinal position. The lack of stability from the ball increases the degree of difficulty. This is a difficult movement, and beginners may need to use a limited range of motion."
Medicine ball pass,力量训练,Abdominals,药球,Intermediate,"The medicine ball pass is a simple partner-based exercise that involves throwing a weighted ball back and forth. It can be part of a dynamic warm-up for lifting or athletics, but can also work as active rest or as a component of circuit training."
Partner medicine ball sit-up,力量训练,Abdominals,药球,Intermediate,"The partner medicine ball sit-up is a more difficult version of the traditional abdominal exercise. Two partners pass a medicine ball back and forth at the top of each rep, so each one must alternate a weighted rep with an unweighted rep. This technique can be done for reps or time in any ab-focused workout, in an ""I go, you go"" format."
Medicine ball Russian twist,力量训练,Abdominals,药球,Intermediate,"The medicine ball Russian twist is a weighted version of a popular abdominal training exercise.

It can also be a component of a power or athleticism-focused circuit workout."
Medicine ball twist,力量训练,Abdominals,药球,Intermediate,"The medicine ball twist is an exercise targeting the abdominal muscles, particularly the obliques. It is similar in many ways to a Russian twist exercise. The ball is held tight to the chest throughout the movement, and then the torso is rotated from side to side for the desired number of reps or a set amount of time."

Sit-up variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more, as part of the core-focused portion of a workout."
Hanging Windshield Wiper,力量训练,Abdominals,徒手,Intermediate,"The hanging windshield wiper is an advanced abdominal training exercise that is also extremely challenging to other muscles of the upper body, including the lats (latissimus dorsi), biceps, and grip. It requires—and builds—great strength in the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles, as well as the obliques and deep core muscles. If you can't perform it hanging from a bar, the lying windshield wiper on the floor provides some of the same benefits."

Seated barbell shoulder press,力量训练,Shoulders,杠铃,Intermediate,"The seated barbell shoulder press is a classic exercise for building muscle and strength in the shoulders. The triceps also play a significant role in pressing the barbell overhead. Performing the movement seated reduces help from the lower body and decreases the risk of overextending the lumbar spine during the movement. This press variation can be the primary pressing movement on an upper-body or shoulder day, or an effective accessory movement later in a workout."
Snatch-Grip Behind-The-Neck Overhead Press,力量训练,Shoulders,杠铃,Beginner,
Standing Bradford press,力量训练,Shoulders,杠铃,Intermediate,"The standing Bradford press is an obscure yet effective shoulder exercise that alternates front presses with behind-the-neck presses. It can be used as a warm-up for other press variations on a shoulder day, or as a muscle-building movement on its own in a shoulder or upper-body focused workout.

Standing Barbell Press Behind Neck,力量训练,Shoulders,杠铃,Intermediate,"The standing behind-the-head press is a classic shoulder exercise that was used widely during bodybuilding's professed Golden Era. In addition to the deltoids, it also works the trapezius and triceps muscles. It may not be a good choice for some people's shoulders, depending on their injury history. It can be trained in strength-focused rep ranges, but is more commonly trained in moderate to high reps, such as 8-15 reps per set."
Barbell front raise,力量训练,Shoulders,杠铃,Intermediate,"The barbell front raise is an upper-body isolation exercise that targets the shoulders. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or higher, as part of the shoulder-focused part of any workout."
Overhead bar front raise,力量训练,Shoulders,杠铃,Intermediate,"The overhead bar front raise is an exercise targeting the muscles of the traps (trapezius), especially the upper traps, as well as the front or anterior shoulders. It can also be performed with a weight plate or dumbbell, providing a neutral grip that may be more shoulder-friendly for some lifters. Overhead raises are most common for high reps (at least 8-12 reps per set or higher) on a shoulder, trap, or other upper-body-focused muscle-building day."
Incline barbell shoulder protraction,力量训练,Shoulders,杠铃,Intermediate,"The incline barbell shoulder protraction is an upper-body movement that targets strength and mobility in the scapula or shoulder blades. This can help increase pressing strength and prevent injury. It also helps develop the serratus anterior, an often-neglected muscle around the ribcage that can aid in shoulder health and upper-body muscle definition. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more."
Behind-the-head push-press,奥林匹克举重,Shoulders,杠铃,Intermediate,The behind-the-head push-press is an overhead press variation in which the barbell starts in the back rack position and is pushed overhead with assistance from the lower body.

It is usually performed one rep of each movement at a time, although you could perform more reps of each, or increase the reps in successive rounds (e.g., 1 rep in round 1, 2 reps in round 2, etc.). No matter how you perform it, it targets both the anterior and medial deltoids, making it a great time-efficient shoulder burnout or accessory movement on an upper-body day."
Single-arm palm-in dumbbell shoulder press,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The single-arm palm-in dumbbell shoulder press builds the shoulder muscles but with two major differences from the standard dumbbell shoulder press. It's done one arm at a time and the wrist stays neutral throughout the movement. It can be performed standing or seated. A single dumbbell press can be pursued as a strength goal, or trained in traditional muscle-building rep ranges such as 8-15 reps per set or more."
Standing palms-in shoulder press,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The standing palms-in shoulder press is a dumbbell exercise targeting the shoulders. It can be performed in strength-focused rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps per set, or for higher reps to build muscle or for conditioning."
Seated Dumbbell Press,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The seated dumbbell shoulder pressis an exercise for building muscle and strengthening the shoulders, particularly but not exclusively the front heads. The triceps also assist. Some lifters feel that using dumbbells versus a barbell reduced injury risk."
Standing dumbbell shoulder press,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The standing dumbbell shoulder press is a classic deltoid-building exercise that is common in gyms around the world. Performing the move standing up as opposed to seated allows more weight to be used and taxes the core more than seated presses. The standing press is worthy of being the main movement in a muscle-building shoulder workout, but is also a great strength movement and accessory for the bench press."
Single-arm lateral raise,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The single-arm lateral raise is a shoulder exercise that targets the medial or middle head of the deltoid muscle. It's a staple strength-training move and is a great option for accessory work on upper-body training days. Hold on to a post for balance, or do it free-standing to challenge core strength and stability. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per side, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout."
Power Partials,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Beginner,
Incline dumbbell reverse fly,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The incline dumbbell reverse fly is an upper-body exercise targeting the posterior or rear deltoids, as well as the postural muscles of the upper back. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more."
Overhead dumbbell front raise,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The overhead dumbbell front raise takes the dumbbell front raise one step further, extending the motion all the way above the head. In addition to the shoulders, it activates and strengthens the muscles of the traps and upper back. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-15 reps or more. It can be part of a dynamic upper-body warm-up, performed as a muscle-building upper-body movement, or as a burnout movement on shoulder day."
Seated dumbbell shoulder press,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The seated dumbbell shoulder press is a popular exercise for building muscle and strength in the shoulders. The triceps also work hard in this lift. Many lifters find using dumbbells to be more comfortable and shoulder-friendly for this press variation than a barbell. This can be the primary pressing movement on an upper-body or shoulder day, or an effective accessory movement later in a workout."
Alternating standing shoulder press,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The alternating standing shoulder press is a popular dumbbell exercise targeting the shoulders. It can be performed in strength-focused rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps per set, or for higher reps to build muscle or for conditioning."
Single-arm incline rear delt raise,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The single-arm incline rear delt raise is an upper-body exercise targeting the posterior deltoids or shoulder muscles, as well as the postural muscles of the upper back. Training each side independently can help correct imbalances in size, strength, and shoulder stability. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more."
Alternating dumbbell front raise,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The alternating dumbbell front raise is a single-joint exercise targeting the shoulder muscles, particularly the front or anterior deltoids. Performing the movement one shoulder at a time gives a momentary rest to each side while the other is working, potentially allowing you to do more reps during each set. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout."
Alternating Deltoid Raise,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,The dumbbell front raise to lateral raise combines two exercises that build and strengthen the middle deltoids and the anterior deltoids of the shoulders.
Single-dumbbell front raise,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The single-dumbbell front raise is an isolation movement that targets the shoulders. In particular, it focuses on the anterior or front head of the deltoid muscles. By performing it with one dumbbell at a time, you can focus on each shoulder muscle independently and try to address muscular imbalances between shoulders. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout."
Arnold press,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"Named after the iconic bodybuilder and movie star, the Arnold press adds rotation to a classic shoulder press. It allows the hands to rotate naturally, while also hitting all three heads of the deltoids in one motion. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout."
Single-arm standing shoulder press,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The single-arm standing shoulder press is a popular exercise to build size and strength the shoulders and triceps. Most lifters find they can go heavier (per arm) on this movement than if they are pressing two dumbbells simultaneously, making it an effective strength movement as well as a muscle-building movement in higher reps."
Dumbbell front raise,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The dumbbell front raise is a single-joint exercise targeting the shoulder muscles, particularly the front or anterior deltoids. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout."
Bent-over dumbbell rear delt row,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The bent-over dumbbell rear delt row is a popular upper-body exercise that targets the muscles on the backside of the shoulder joint, specifically the medial and rear heads of the deltoid. Since pressing movements build the front and (to a lesser degree) side deltoid heads, this move is often done to promote balanced shoulder development. It is usually performed for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more, as part of a shoulder or upper-body workout."
Incline dumbbell front raise,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The incline dumbbell front raise is an upper-body exercise targeting the shoulders. Because it is performed face down on an angled bench, it has a greater range of motion than standing or upright-seated raises and hits the shoulders from a different angle. Raise variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or shoulder-focused training."
Side Lateral Raise,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The dumbbell lateral raise is an upper body isolation exercise for building shoulder strength and muscle. It's a staple strength training move and is a great option for accessory work on upper body training days. This exercise particularly focuses on the lateral or medial head of the deltoid, making them appear wider and more developed."
Dumbbell external shoulder rotation,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The dumbbell external shoulder rotation is a lightweight dumbbell exercise intended to maintain the health of the shoulder joints, including the rotator cuffs. It is often used as a warm-up or prehab for a shoulder or chest-focused workout with lots of pressing."
Single-arm incline lateral raise,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The single-arm incline lateral raise is an exercise targeting the lateral or medial head of the shoulder muscles. It is performed lying sideways on an incline bench set to around 45 degrees, which helps to increase the range of motion in the lift and enforce strict form. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more."
Seated rear delt fly,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The seated rear delt fly is an upper-body exercise that targets the real deltoid of the shoulder. By performing the movement seated, it eliminates momentum from the rest of the body. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout."

Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more."
Head-on-bench dumbbell rear delt raise,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The head-on-bench dumbbell rear delt raise is an exercise targeting the posterior shoulder muscles, or rear deltoids. This variation of the bent-over rear delt raise often helps to better isolate this area of the shoulder. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more."
Cuban press,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The Cuban press is an exercise that targets the muscles of the shoulders, rotator cuff, and upper back. It combines a shoulder external rotation with a dumbbell press, training multiple muscles and motions in a single sequence. It can be performed standing, or as a more difficult variation face-down on an incline bench. It is usually performed with relatively light weight as part of a dynamic warm-up for upper-body lifting."
Reverse Flyes With External Rotation,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Beginner,
Single-arm side lying rear fly,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The single-arm side lying rear fly is an upper-body exercise that targets the rear deltoid of the shoulder. By performing the movement lying on a bench, it eliminates momentum from the rest of the body. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout."
Single-arm dumbbell upright row,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The single-arm dumbbell upright row is a popular movement for building stronger and bigger traps and shoulders. Many lifters combine this move with either their back or shoulder workout, since it involves both body parts. It is generally performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more."

Single-arm half-kneeling shoulder press,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The single-arm half-kneeling shoulder press is a popular exercise to target the deltoid muscles while also developing strength and stability in the core and hips. Balance can be a challenge, which is one reason why this movement is generally trained lighter than standing single-arm shoulder presses. The half-kneeling press can be used as an accessory lift for the shoulder press or bench press, or simply as a technique to make shoulder presses stricter and more athletic."
Dumbbell Clean And Jerk,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Beginner,
Dumbbell shoulder press with body rotation,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The dumbbell shoulder press with body rotation is a twist on the traditional dumbbell shoulder press. Rather than pressing straight overhead, you twist your torso and hips to the side during each rep. It hits the deltoid muscles just like a shoulder press, but adds a challenge to the core, hips, and back muscles. Due to the potential balance challenge of twisting and pressing at the same time, it is commonly performed with light to moderate weights."

Performing the movement from the hang position, rather than from the ground, emphasizes explosive hip and upper-body power. It can be performed for low reps with a focus on power and speed, or for higher reps to build muscle or as part of a metabolic conditioning circuit."
Surfer sprawl,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The surfer sprawl is an explosive bodyweight exercise that targets multiple muscle groups across the upper and lower body. It is similar to a burpee, but instead of jumping at the top, you end in a ""surfer position,"" alternating sides with each rep. It can be performed for time or reps in any fat-loss or athleticism-focused circuit or workout. The surfer position offers a unique way to challenge the body by staying in a low position rather than standing up after the plank."
Dumbbell clean and press,力量训练,Shoulders,哑铃,Intermediate,"The dumbbell clean and press is a full-body movement that targets both the lower and upper body. The clean utilizes the muscles of the hips, legs, glutes, back, and biceps, while the press utilizes the shoulders and triceps.

The top of the movement receives less help from the band, putting more stress on the triceps."
